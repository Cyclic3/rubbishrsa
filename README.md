## Usage and examples
**_NOTE_**: if you want to encrypt/decrypt raw hexadecimal values, then use the `-x` flag.

### Generating a key
`rubbishrsa-cli gen -o private_key -p public_key -s 2048`

This will generate a key of `2048` bits, and put the private key in a file called `private_key` and the public key in a file called `public_key`.
### Encrypting a message
`rubbishrsa-cli enc -p public_key -m "hello" -o ctext`

This will create a file called `ctext`, which will contain the message `hello` encrypted with the key found in the file `public_key`.

### Decrypting a message
`rubbishrsa-cli dec -k private_key -i ctext`
This will print the result of decrypting the cyphertext found in `ctext` with the private key found in the file `private_key`.
